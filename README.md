# SimpleJSGui
My aim with this project is to give developers a library that they can use to create web apps in a desktop-like sandbox.
# Theme customization
I've developed this library in a way that, from the graphical perspective, the developers can change the way their apps and other elements in the SimpleJSGui library sandbox look simply by customizing the CSS files. With other words (and for the most part), no changes to JS files need to be made to change the graphical look and feel of SimpleJSGui.
# Tutorials on using SimpleJSGui
I will write the tutorials and the documentation for SimpleJSGui in the future, which should help with developing apps with the library and creating and customizing themes for it.
